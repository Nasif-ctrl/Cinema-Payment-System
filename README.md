# Cinema Payment System with C++  

## üìù __Overview__  
This program was created for people eager to watch movies in cinema halls during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It simulates a registration process that requires only one person to go to the counter for buying tickets on behalf of a group and minimize human contact. Thus it can help to maintain social distance during the pandemic.
The source code was written and compiled using Dev-C++ IDE running on Windows 10 operating system.

Used to check if seat limit is reached and decide whether to exit or continue based on user input (flag).  

  
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è __How to Run the Program__  
Simply open the CPP file double-clicking on it. If you are using Dev-C++, click on te Compile icon in the taskbar near the top of the window or press F9. If compilation succeeds, click on the Run icon or press F10.  
  
### Once the Program is running:

The user is greeted and is asked to enter their Name and Phone Number. (Hit Enter after typing the input)

The user is then asked to enter the number corresponding to the movie they want to watch. (The order and serial number can be manually customized in the source code)

Hitting Enter displays a summary of the information provided (Customer info and price based on age group).

It also the total sales and number of seats remaining for a session. The program can continue to run by another user or terminated.  

## üìå __Things to Keep in Mind__  
* Entering invalid inputs (such as typing letters for integer variables) can lead to the program terminating unexpectedly.  
* When entering the phone number, if the number begins with a 0, the 0 gets omitted because the variable's data type is integer.
